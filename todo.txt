 - Map screen
 - Sounds:
   - Collected all diamonds
   - Level end
   - Gravity inversion
   - Extra life
   - Teleport
   - Touch barrier
 - Levels
 - Teleport effect
 - Timer increase animation when bean is collected
 - Should actions that pause the original game pause the remake, even though
   they only pause because the Speccy couldn't play complex sounds as well as do
   anything else simultaneously?
