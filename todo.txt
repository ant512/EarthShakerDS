 - New screens:
   - Game complete
   - Between level screen
   - Map screen
 - High scores:
   - If we allow high scores we have to allow high score entry, which means a
     keyboard or at least d-pad driven character selection.
   - We should also save them to disk
   - High score tables are rubbish (especially for this game as scoring really
     isn't an objective).
   - What could we replace them with on the title screen?
     - Animated display of all interesting blocks, along with their names and
       what they do?
 - Screen transition animations?
 - Pause button?
 - High scores?
 - Save high scores?
 - Sounds
   - What should the makefile do to get the soundbank built?
 - Levels
 - Should actions that pause the original game pause the remake, even though
   they only pause because the Speccy couldn't play complex sounds as well as do
   anything else simultaneously?
 - Does timer turn blue when player commits suicide?
