 - Implement all scoring:
   - Level finished - bonus for completion?  Time remaining bonus?
 - Map screen
 - Suicide button for when player is stuck.  Options:
   - Both shoulder buttons simultaneously
   - Pause menu gives the option
 - New screens:
   - Menu screen - level select, etc.
   - Game over
   - Between level sequence?

 - End of level code needs to improve - currently the door is deleted whilst
   its code is running.  Maybe get the door to notify the game that it has
   ended then the game can deal with the notification later
 - Need some way of specifying starting door colour - perhaps an extra
   constructor parameter?
 - Timer should zip to 0 at level end.
 - Should player move onto the door block at the end of the level, or stay on
   the previous block?

   - Should the blocks fall?  If so, do they kill when falling on the player?
