EarthShakerDS
-------------

EarthShakerDS is a remake of a Sinclair ZX Spectrum game written in 1990 by
Michael Batty.  It is similar to Boulderdash.  The objective of the game is to
collect all of the diamonds in each level, avoiding falling boulders, fires,
etc.


Menu System
-----------

When the game starts, a menu system appears on the top screen.  You can choose
to start from the beginning of the game ("Start") or select a level from the
level select menu ("Level Select").  Navigate to the desired option using the up
and down buttons or the Select button.  You can page through the options more
quickly by using the left and right buttons.  When the correct option is
highlighted, press A or Start to select it.  The B button returns to the
previous menu if a submenu is selected.


Controls
--------

The d-pad moves around the level.

If you make a mistake and get stuck, you can press L and R simultaneously to
commit suicide and restart the level.

Press X to bring up a map screen and press X again to switch back to the game.
Note that you can only bring up the map screen once per life per level, so only
look at it when you need to.

Press Start to pause the game.  Press it again to unpause.


Gameplay
--------

Collect all of the diamonds in each level.  When all of the diamonds are
collected, a notification sound will play and the door - located somewhere in
the level - will start flashing.  Enter the door to end the level.  You can be
killed by:

 - Blocks landing on your head;
 - Walking into fire;
 - Running out of time.


Blocks
------

The following blocks can be found at various points in the game:

 - Bubbles can be pushed around.  They can be pushed into fires to extinguish
   the fires.  They can also be used to prop up boulders.
 - Boulders fall if not supported.  They can be pushed around.
 - Diamonds can be collected.
 - Fires will destroy boulders that land on them.  They can be extinguished by
   bubbles.
 - Jumping jelly beans give a time bonus.
 - Teleporters transport the player from one location to another.
 - Elixirs give an extra life.
 - Soil is removed when the player walks over it,
 - Wet soil behaves like normal soil, except it falls like boulders.  Wet soil
   landing on the player will not harm the player.
 - Gravity inverters switch the direction of gravity.  Boulders and other blocks
   landing on the player when gravity is inverted will not kill the player.
   Gravity remains inverted until the gravity timer runs out.  The direction of
   gravity and the remaining time are both displayed at the bottom of the screen
   next to the green "g".
 - Barriers block your path.  They decrease the amount of remaining time if you
   walk into them.
 - Barrier controllers will destroy all barriers when they are themselves
   destroyed.  Drop a boulder onto them.


Requirements
------------

To play the game you will need a flash cart and a DS or a DS emulator such as
DeSmuME.  To compile the sourcecode you will need to install devKitARM and the
WoopsiGfx library.
